Project: Detecting function of the minimal proteome 
I want to examine all of the proteins that mycolasma laboratorium syn3A expresses. 
please download the genome of syn3A from JCVI and proceed doing the analyses detailed below. 

Step 1: sequence based homology
Specifically, I want to test their sequence homology to all mycoplasmal proteins (that are not in subspecies capri)
Then, I would like to test their sequence homology to all bacterial proteins that are not mycoplasmas.
